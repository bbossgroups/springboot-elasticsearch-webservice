# Demo Introduce 

Web service demo based on spring boot 1.x,2.x and Elasticsearch bboss client，include following elasticsearch operations:

1. check indice exists
2. Delete existing indice
3. Create indice by dsl
4. Get the indice definition structure
5. Create/modify/delete/query index documents
6. search documents pararrel
7. database-elasticsearch数据同步
8. hbase-elasticsearch数据同步
9. file-elasticsearch数据同步

# Demo build 

Modify the es address in springboot-elasticsearch\src\main\resources\application.properties file:

```java
spring.elasticsearch.bboss.elasticsearch.rest.hostNames=192.168.137.1:9200
```

Then run the maven build packaging directive:

```
mvn clean package
```



# Demo run 

First run elasticsearch 5 or elasticsearch 6 or elasticsearch 7，run hbase and database for hbase-elasticsearch and database-elasticsearch. 

Then run the demo:

```
mvn clean install
cd target

java -jar es_bboss_web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```



# Run the service

Enter the following address in the browser to perform the add, delete, modify and search operations:

Elasticsearch 7以下版本

http://localhost:808/testBBossIndexCrud

Elasticsearch 7及以上版本

http://localhost:808/testBBossIndexCrud7

# 本demo还包含三个数据同步的案例：
- DB-Elasticsearch数据同步
- Hbase-Elasticsearch数据同步（基于hbase 2.2.3开发，如果需要对接其他版本，需要调整pom.xml中的hbase-shaded-client maven坐标版本号）
```xml
	    <dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.hbase</groupId>
			<artifactId>hbase-shaded-client</artifactId>
			<version>2.2.3</version>
		</dependency>
```
- File-Elasticsearch数据采集
